----

* This repo automates the process defined [here](https://github.com/widget-/slack-black-theme) to change the slack theme to dark mode .
* Currently it only supports Mac OS.

## Installation
* Run the following commands one by one in terminal
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arslanraza/slack-dark-theme
cd slack-dark-theme
./run.sh
```

* Once the installation is successful, you should see an output like this
```sh
Closing Slack if its running...
Done...
```

* The above has been tested on **MAC OS Mojave** running latest version of slack (3.3.3).
