# slack-dark-theme
----

* This repo automates the process defined [here](https://github.com/widget-/slack-black-theme) to change the slack theme to dark mode .
* Currently it only supports Mac OS.

## Installation
* Run the following commands one by one in terminal
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arslanraza/slack-dark-theme
cd slack-dark-theme
./run.sh
```

* A menu will be displayed in terminal window as following
```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 M A I N - M E N U
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Apply Dark theme
2. Restore Light theme
3. Exit
Enter choice [ 1 - 3]
```

* Select 1 if you want to apply dark theme or 2 if you want to revert it back to light theme.
* Once the installation is successful, you should see an output like this
```sh
Closing Slack if its running...
Done...
```

* The above has been tested on **MAC OS Mojave** running latest version of slack (3.3.3).
